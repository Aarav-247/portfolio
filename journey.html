  <h2 id="intro">My Journey In Sports</h2>
  <p>My journey in sports has been an exciting and evolving one. From a young age, I developed a deep love for cricket. I joined a cricket academy, and that experience only strengthened my passion for the game, allowing me to grow and hone my skills. However, life had more surprises in store. When I was selected for my school’s football team, I found myself drawn to the game in a way I hadn’t expected. Football became a new passion, and I dove into it with the same enthusiasm I had for cricket.

    In July 2023, while playing football, I had a major setback – I fractured my leg. The injury required surgery, and a rod had to be inserted into my leg to aid recovery. It was a challenging time, but I remained determined. After a period of healing, I returned to the field. My love for football only grew stronger, and I proved to myself that no matter the obstacles, I would keep playing and pushing forward.</p>

    <h2 id="journey">My Journey In Technology</h2>
  <p>My journey in technology began with an unexpected yet exciting opportunity. I was selected for the Reelcraft inter-school competition, where we were tasked with creating a 4-5 minute movie on a given topic. This experience sparked my interest in tech, and from that moment, I knew I wanted to dive deeper into this field.

    Since then, I've had the chance to represent my school in a variety of tech competitions, including gaming events like Valorant tournaments, where I not only showcased my skills but also developed a deeper understanding of the technology behind the games I loved.
    
    Most recently, my school hosted a massive inter-school tech event called QuantumX, with over 10 categories, and I had the privilege of being a core member of the organizing team. I was also entrusted with the role of head for all the gaming events, a responsibility I took with great pride. This journey has been an exciting blend of creativity, leadership, and technological innovation, and I can't wait to continue exploring new opportunities in this ever-evolving field.</p>

<h2 id="hobbies">My Journey In Gaming</h2>
  <p>My journey in gaming began when I was just 8 years old, and the first game I ever played was *GTA San Andreas*. That was the spark that ignited my passion for gaming. Over time, my interest grew, and I found myself immersed in *Minecraft*, which really caught my attention. During the COVID lockdown, I spent countless hours playing *Minecraft* while attending online classes, treating the game as a background escape from the lessons.

    As I delved deeper into the world of gaming, I started to develop a keen interest in story-driven games. The *GTA* series, *Spider-Man* series, *Assassin's Creed* series, and many more became my favorite experiences, offering rich narratives and thrilling adventures. At the same time, I began exploring FPS games like *Valorant* and *Counter-Strike*, which tested my skills in strategy, reflexes, and teamwork.
    
    Despite having a laptop that wasn’t built for gaming and often struggled to run these games, I refused to give up. I continued to game on that old laptop, pushing its limits and making the most of what I had. After three years of persistence, my parents finally agreed to let me get a new gaming laptop. That moment was a dream come true, and it opened up a whole new world of possibilities in my gaming journey.</p>
