  <p>I initially had a deep passion for cricket, dedicating most of my time to the sport and enjoying every moment of it. However, my perspective shifted when I was selected for the school football team, and that's when football truly captured my heart. The fast pace, teamwork, and thrill of the game drew me in, and I began to focus more on honing my football skills. Being part of the football team marked a pivotal moment in my sports career, transitioning my love from cricket to football.</p>

  <h2>Developing Minecraft Servers</h2>
  <p>I developed a passion for Minecraft server development when I was just 10 years old, finding it fascinating to create and manage unique worlds. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills and built several servers, many of which I designed specifically for my school community. I enjoy the creative and technical challenges involved in server development, from configuring plugins to optimizing performance. It's a hobby that not only allows me to experiment with coding and design but also enables me to bring people together through shared experiences in the game.</p>
